# pgxmap

Collection of helper functions to convert to and from pgtypes.

[pgtype](https://github.com/jackc/pgtype) is the type system underlying the (pgx)[https://github.com/jackc/pgx] PostgreSQL driver. 

I have created this off of past experience with the native [go database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) drivers. I have yet to determine how necessary this repo is. If it proves to be useless I will delete this is very much in Beta..
